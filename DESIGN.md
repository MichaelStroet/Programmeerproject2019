# Design document
## Michael Stroet - 11293284

<!--
Based on your proposal, you can now start studying your problem in a more technical fashion. Map the separate parts of the solution onto the framework(s) that you are using. What APIs, methods or techniques do you need to implement each feature?

Think about and fully express how the user interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various parts will work together to form a complete application.

The teaching staff and your fellow students can help you spot fundamental problems that need to be solved, or if technical limitations will likely prevent you from finishing the project.

Design doc for data visualizations
    For this deadline, you must prove that you have access to the data in a usable format!

    Some parts that you should describe here:

    a list of data sources if you will get data from an external source, including information on how your are going to filter and transform the data for your project

    a diagram with an overview of the technical components of your app (visualizations, scraper etc etc)

    as well as descriptions of each of the components and what you need to implement these

    a list of APIs or D3 plugins that you will be using to provide functionality in your app
