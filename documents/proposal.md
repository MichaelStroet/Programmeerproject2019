## Project Proposal


<!--
Project Proposal
You’ll kick off your project by handing in a proposal document. This document should connect the functional design of your project (what does it do?) to a problem in the real world. Below, we list all required aspects of your proposal document.

Getting started
To start your project, you should create a new empty Github repository. Your project proposal must be written in Markdown and be saved in the repository as README.md. This will make sure that the proposal is easily viewable for the staff.

If needed, refer to the documentation:

Github
Markdown
Goal of the document
You and others can use this document to estimate the effort required to implement the project. Your project has a high risk of failure if:

the envisioned product tries to do too much
the envisioned product doesn’t do enough
the purpose of the product is not well-defined (too vague)
By writing a clear proposal document and getting feedback on it from multiple students and teachers, you can better avoid these risks!

Problem statement
Write a brief statement, four lines of text, about the problem that your finished product will solve. The problem has to be clearly described and very specific. We see two possibilities:

There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonably large group of people have, which an app or visualization can solve particularly well.
There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding that an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy.
In both cases, you should be able to define a target audience who have specific interests that match your project. Include that, too.

Solution
Describe your solution in full detail.

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the problem that you have defined.

Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

 Example sketch for a mobile app

 Example sketch for a data visualization

Include a brief list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. If you have complicated features, it might be good to create a separate sketch for each feature.

Mark which features define the minimum viable product (MVP) and which parts may be optional to implement.

Prerequisites
Describe the things that you’ll have to get in order before really starting your project.

List the data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources can be found.

List the external components (libraries like d3-tip or SQLite) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not standard, include a link to its website.

Include a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?

Identify the hardest parts of implementing your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.

Sanity check
Before continuing, compare your solution to the project requirements one last time. Also, is it still clear that your proposed project is indeed a solution to the stated problem?

Also, the proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

Finally, make sure that your document is spell-checked, and that images are not too large or too small (your document will be read in a normal browser via GitHub).

Submitting
After you have pushed all changes to Github, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be in this format: https://github.com/username/project.

Don’t commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the README.md, a doc folder (exactly that name), pictures in the doc folder, and nothing else.

What’s next
The next step in your project is creating a design document. There, you’ll describe how your project will be created according to the rules of the application framework that you’re using.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on the GitHub Issues for your project. This is where you will get feedback on whether your project is accepted as it is described, or you need to make some changes.
